anarchism is political philosophy that advocates self governed societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non hierarchical or free associations anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful while anti statism is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations anarchism is usually considered far left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics anarchism does not offer fixed body of doctrine from single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications etymology and terminology the word anarchism is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν an without and archos leader ruler cf archon or arkhē authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix ίζειν izein the first known use of this word was in various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as robespierre did the hébertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century since the and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the in the united states its use as synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism history origins woodcut from diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote petty thief is put in jail great brigand becomes ruler of nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics as well as their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is right for each individual within the islamic society the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in during the english civil war as term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents by the time of the french revolution some such as the enragés began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic by the turn of the th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean jacques rousseau arguments for the moral centrality of freedom as part of the political turmoil of the in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought godwin was according to peter kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke william godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of rules based society led him to denounce as manifestation of the people mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at mutually beneficial method of social organisation in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement the french pierre joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use later however proudhon added that property is liberty and argued that it was bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time the anarcho communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike pierre joseph proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature in in germany the post hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism french anarchists active in the revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph déjacque and pierre joseph proudhon first international and the paris commune anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coruña in which was inspired by proudhon ideas the catalan politician francesc pi margall became the principal translator of proudhon works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party according to george woodcock these translations were to have profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early according to the encyclopædia britannica during the spanish revolution of pi margall attempted to establish decentralised or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines in the international workingmen association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became significant organisation karl marx became leading figure in the international and member of its general council proudhon followers the mutualists opposed marx state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william greene had been members of the first international in following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads mikhail bakunin characterised marx ideas as centralist and predicted that if marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in the general council called only special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while technical excuse that they had split away from the fédération romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin swiss supporters thus only tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers in the conflict climaxed with final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting revolutionary anarchist programme the paris commune was government that briefly ruled paris from march more formally from march to may the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the re opening of workplaces as co operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the commune ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas indeed the commune vision of communal france based on federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin and proudhon ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states organised labour the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labour in the federation of organized trades and labor unions fotlu of the united states and canada unanimously set may as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed anarchists of chicago after the haymarket affair the haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances in response unions across the united states prepared general strike in support of the event on may in chicago fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd the next day may anarchists staged rally at chicago haymarket square bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day in second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker holiday in the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which were important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoît broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it the spanish workers federation in was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in before the the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish as revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to membership of nearly quarter of million which dwarfed the rival unions propaganda of the deed and illegalism italian american anarchist luigi galleani his followers known as galleanists carried out series of bombings and assassination attempts from to in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed however most himself once boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most is best known for pamphlet published in the science of revolutionary warfare how to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey by the people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides from onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt france bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with few kilos of dynamite variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter state repression including the infamous french lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france empress elisabeth of austria king umberto of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos of portugal and king george of greece mckinley assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman russian revolution and other uprisings of the nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution however following political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine there in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for number of months expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised for them bakunin predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become new elite had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international the revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism in the german uprising known as the german revolution of which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to members and the influence of the italian anarchist union members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early it led series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho communist ricardo flores magón in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations conflicts with european fascist regimes in the and the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism conflict with the state italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists italian anarchists played key role in the anti fascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution in france where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february riots anarchists divided over united front policy anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of february within few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg on february mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of july mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in latrine the next morning spanish revolution in spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union confederación nacional del trabajo initially refused to join popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to right wing election victory but in the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later conservative members of the military with the support of minority extreme right parties responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land but even before the fascist victory in the anarchists were losing ground in bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union according to noam chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists not just in catalonia the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against hitler that of course failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves the events known as the spanish revolution was workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante much of spain economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on vast scale than any other revolution in history spanish communist party led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non francoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía post war years anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france the mexican anarchist federation was established in after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district in the early the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association from to the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime in in france the fédération anarchiste and the trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september and in the japanese anarchist federation was founded an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them by february the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was large scale operation the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until in the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded in the anarcho communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation the syndicalist workers federation was syndicalist group in active in post war britain and one of solidarity federation earliest predecessors it was formed in by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain unlike the afb which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock leopold kohr julian beck john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste anarcho pacifism became influential in the anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day anarcho pacifism became basis for critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham anarchism documentary history of libertarian ideas volume two the emergence of the new anarchism contemporary anarchism squat near parc güell overlooking barcelona squatting was prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the and on the roof occupy and resist surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the and anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts in in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing european federations of france the fédération anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile in the united kingdom in the this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century number of new movements and schools of thought emerged although feminist tendencies have always been part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and that is so palpable locally and globally international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo cgt and the cnt cgt membership was estimated at around for anarchist schools of thought portrait of philosopher pierre joseph proudhon by gustave courbet proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement in chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism blackwell encyclopaedia of political thought blackwell publishing proudhon first characterised his goal as third form of society the synthesis of communism and property social anarchism social anarchism calls for system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion it is the largest school of thought in anarchism social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or form of such is revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of post revolutionary transition to communist system of distribution according to need anarcho communism anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need russian theorist peter kropotkin who was influential in the development of anarchist communism some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro and insurrectionary anti sections to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini spanish communist party repression backed by the ussr as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from before being conquered by the bolsheviks in anarcho syndicalism may day demonstration of spanish anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country in anarcho syndicalism is branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing representative to government position will allow workers to liberate themselves moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of new society should be self managing they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement he outlined view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his pamphlet anarcho syndicalism the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries the spanish confederación nacional del trabajo played and still plays major role in the spanish labour movement it was also an important force in the spanish civil war individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems individualist anarchism is not single philosophy but refers to group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict in william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism godwin philosophical anarchist from rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw minimal state as present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good th century philosopher max stirner usually considered prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by friedrich engels an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner stirner the ego and its own published in is founding text of the philosophy according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as form of organisation in place of the state egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner philosophy it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form henry david thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading he is best known for his books walden reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state later benjamin tucker fused stirner egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others post classical schools of thought lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho primitivism while jarach is noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches green anarchism or eco anarchism is school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology writing from green anarchist perspective john zerzan attributes the ills of today social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization while layla abdelrahim argues that the shift in human consciousness was also shift in human subsistence strategies whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby violence thus according to her civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics language and literacy she claims are some of these technologies anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism it generally views patriarchy as manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa susan brown claims that as anarchism is political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist anarcha feminism began with the late th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre anarcho pacifism is tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war christian anarchism is movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul platformism is tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement failures during the russian revolution synthesis anarchism is form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and sébastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations post left anarchy is recent current in anarchist thought that promotes critique of anarchism relationship to traditional left wing politics some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting critique of organisations and morality influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by focus on social insurrection and rejection of leftist social organisation insurrectionary anarchism is revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on political programme and periodic congresses instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies post anarchism is theoretical move towards synthesis of classical anarchist theory and thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy situationist international and postcolonialism left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labour positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self ownership in free market anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory there is strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho capitalism cannot be considered part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms internal issues and debates consistent with anarchist values is controversial subject among anarchists anarchism is philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism syndicalism trade unionism and capitalism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others on tactical level while propaganda of the deed was tactic used by anarchists in the th century the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate global one while others do so by local ones the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory free love french individualist anarchist emile armand who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century an important current within anarchism is free love free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as clear direct expression of an individual sovereignty free love particularly stressed women rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood the word free society as the firebrand as free society was major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries the publication advocated free love and women rights and critiqued comstockery censorship of sexual information also lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love in new york city greenwich village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others magnus hirschfeld noted in that goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public in fact before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the in his detroit based german language journal der arme teufel english the poor devil in argentina anarcha feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called english the woman voice which was published nine times in rosario between january and january and was revived briefly in in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults he was also consistent proponent of polyamory in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality mujeres libres was an anarchist women organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women it was founded in by lucía sánchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch gascón and had approximately members the organisation was based on the idea of double struggle for women liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists lucía sánchez saornil was main founder of the spanish anarcha feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism she was published in variety of literary journals where working under male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment more recently the british anarcho pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex the issue of free love has dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire and invention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques libertarian education and freethought francesc ferrer guàrdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and free thinker for english anarchist william godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness for godwin education had to have respect for the child autonomy which precluded any form of coercion pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child own motivation and initiatives and concern about the child capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school in his political justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established max stirner wrote in long essay on education called the false principle of our education in it stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment in the united states freethought was basically anti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters number of contributors to liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism the individualist anarchist george macdonald was co editor of freethought and for time the truth seeker walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal lucifer the light bearer many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer the light bearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty the church was viewed as common ally of the state and as repressive force in and of itself in catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in rational secular and non coercive setting fiercely anti clerical ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state murray bookchin wrote this period was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence perhaps the best known effort in this field was francisco ferrer modern school escuela moderna project which exercised considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally la escuela moderna and ferrer ideas generally formed the inspiration for series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london the first of these was started in new york city in it also inspired the italian newspaper università popolare founded in russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established school for peasant children on his estate tolstoy educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to neill founding what became summerhill school in summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of consumer society instead criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms

greek classical uncial version latin ad uncial version the earliest certain ancestor of is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from true alphabet in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as triangular head with two horns extended by bc the phoenician alphabet letter had linear form that served as the base for some later forms its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph blackletter ablackletter uncial auncial another capital aanother blackletter modern roman amodern roman modern italic amodern italic modern script amodern script when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems px english in modern english orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is

cave has been dated as early as to bc the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the word spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou sources disagree on the word meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the

exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in it was one of the rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to at the same time many rural people both white and african american migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city by the birmingham was the th largest city in the united states and had more than of the state population heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following lawsuit and court order beginning in the when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters the legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as violation of the fifteenth amendment the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution in the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently in the legislature study noted that because of rural domination minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county alabama challenged the state legislature lack of redistricting for congressional seats in white crook judge frank johnson ordered the state to redistrict united states supreme court cases of baker carr and reynolds sims ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as alabama had used for its senate in for the first time since the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been for more than years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the and to end and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in the us supreme court ruled in brown board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the congress legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by many of alabama african americans were living in the alabama cities particularly birmingham and montgomery in addition the rural black belt called that for its soil that stretches across the middle of the state is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry despite recommendations of alabama constitutional commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties there is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county level functions and policies this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the an omnibus redistricting case dillard crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens geography general map of alabama alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the united states with of total area of the
