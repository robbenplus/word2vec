anarchism is political philosophy that advocates self governed societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non hierarchical or free associations anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful while anti statism is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations anarchism is usually considered far left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics anarchism does not offer fixed body of doctrine from single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications etymology and terminology the word anarchism is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν an without and archos leader ruler cf archon or arkhē authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix ίζειν izein the first known use of this word was in various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as robespierre did the hébertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century since the and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the in the united states its use as synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism history origins woodcut from diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote petty thief is put in jail great brigand becomes ruler of nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics as well as their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is right for each individual within the islamic society the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in during the english civil war as term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents by the time of the french revolution some such as the enragés began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic by the turn of the th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean jacques rousseau arguments for the moral centrality of freedom as part of the political turmoil of the in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought godwin was according to peter kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke william godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of rules based society led him to denounce as manifestation of the people mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at mutually beneficial method of social organisation in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement the french pierre joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use later however proudhon added that property is liberty and argued that it was bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time the anarcho communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike pierre joseph proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature in in germany the post hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism french anarchists active in the revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph déjacque and pierre joseph proudhon first international and the paris commune anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coruña in which was inspired by proudhon ideas the catalan politician francesc pi margall became the principal translator of proudhon works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party according to george woodcock these translations were to have profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early according to the encyclopædia britannica during the spanish revolution of pi margall attempted to establish decentralised or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines in the international workingmen association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became significant organisation karl marx became leading figure in the international and member of its general council proudhon followers the mutualists opposed marx state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william greene had been members of the first international in following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads mikhail bakunin characterised marx ideas as centralist and predicted that if marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in the general council called only special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while technical excuse that they had split away from the fédération romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin swiss supporters thus only tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers in the conflict climaxed with final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting revolutionary anarchist programme the paris commune was government that briefly ruled paris from march more formally from march to may the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the re opening of workplaces as co operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the commune ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas indeed the commune vision of communal france based on federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin and proudhon ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states organised labour the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labour in the federation of organized trades and labor unions fotlu of the united states and canada unanimously set may as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed anarchists of chicago after the haymarket affair the haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances in response unions across the united states prepared general strike in support of the event on may in chicago fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd the next day may anarchists staged rally at chicago haymarket square bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day in second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker holiday in the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which were important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoît broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it the spanish workers federation in was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in before the the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish as revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to membership of nearly quarter of million which dwarfed the rival unions propaganda of the deed and illegalism italian american anarchist luigi galleani his followers known as galleanists carried out series of bombings and assassination attempts from to in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed however most himself once boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most is best known for pamphlet published in the science of revolutionary warfare how to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey by the people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides from onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt france bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with few kilos of dynamite variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter state repression including the infamous french lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france empress elisabeth of austria king umberto of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos of portugal and king george of greece mckinley assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman russian revolution and other uprisings of the nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution however following political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine there in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for number of months expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised for them bakunin predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become new elite had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international the revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism in the german uprising known as the german revolution of which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to members and the influence of the italian anarchist union members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early it led series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho communist ricardo flores magón in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations conflicts with european fascist regimes in the and the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism conflict with the state italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists italian anarchists played key role in the anti fascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution in france where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february riots anarchists divided over united front policy anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of february within few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg on february mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of july mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in latrine the next morning spanish revolution in spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union confederación nacional del trabajo initially refused to join popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to right wing election victory but in the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later conservative members of the military with the support of minority extreme right parties responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land but even before the fascist victory in the anarchists were losing ground in bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union according to noam chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists not just in catalonia the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against hitler that of course failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves the events known as the spanish revolution was workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante much of spain economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on vast scale than any other revolution in history spanish communist party led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non francoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía post war years anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france the mexican anarchist federation was established in after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district in the early the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association from to the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime in in france the fédération anarchiste and the trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september and in the japanese anarchist federation was founded an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them by february the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was large scale operation the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until in the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded in the anarcho communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation the syndicalist workers federation was syndicalist group in active in post war britain and one of solidarity federation earliest predecessors it was formed in by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain unlike the afb which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock leopold kohr julian beck john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste anarcho pacifism became influential in the anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day anarcho pacifism became basis for critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham anarchism documentary history of libertarian ideas volume two the emergence of the new anarchism contemporary anarchism squat near parc güell overlooking barcelona squatting was prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the and on the roof occupy and resist surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the and anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts in in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing european federations of france the fédération anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile in the united kingdom in the this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century number of new movements and schools of thought emerged although feminist tendencies have always been part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and that is so palpable locally and globally international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo cgt and the cnt cgt membership was estimated at around for anarchist schools of thought portrait of philosopher pierre joseph proudhon by gustave courbet proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement in chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism blackwell encyclopaedia of political thought blackwell publishing proudhon first characterised his goal as third form of society the synthesis of communism and property social anarchism social anarchism calls for system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion it is the largest school of thought in anarchism social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or form of such is revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of post revolutionary transition to communist system of distribution according to need anarcho communism anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need russian theorist peter kropotkin who was influential in the development of anarchist communism some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro and insurrectionary anti sections to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini spanish communist party repression backed by the ussr as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from before being conquered by the bolsheviks in anarcho syndicalism may day demonstration of spanish anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country in anarcho syndicalism is branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing representative to government position will allow workers to liberate themselves moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of new society should be self managing they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement he outlined view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his pamphlet anarcho syndicalism the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries the spanish confederación nacional del trabajo played and still plays major role in the spanish labour movement it was also an important force in the spanish civil war individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems individualist anarchism is not single philosophy but refers to group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict in william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism godwin philosophical anarchist from rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw minimal state as present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good th century philosopher max stirner usually considered prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by friedrich engels an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner stirner the ego and its own published in is founding text of the philosophy according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as form of organisation in place of the state egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner philosophy it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form henry david thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading he is best known for his books walden reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state later benjamin tucker fused stirner egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others post classical schools of thought lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho primitivism while jarach is noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches green anarchism or eco anarchism is school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology writing from green anarchist perspective john zerzan attributes the ills of today social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization while layla abdelrahim argues that the shift in human consciousness was also shift in human subsistence strategies whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby violence thus according to her civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics language and literacy she claims are some of these technologies anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism it generally views patriarchy as manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa susan brown claims that as anarchism is political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist anarcha feminism began with the late th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre anarcho pacifism is tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war christian anarchism is movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul platformism is tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement failures during the russian revolution synthesis anarchism is form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and sébastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations post left anarchy is recent current in anarchist thought that promotes critique of anarchism relationship to traditional left wing politics some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting critique of organisations and morality influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by focus on social insurrection and rejection of leftist social organisation insurrectionary anarchism is revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on political programme and periodic congresses instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies post anarchism is theoretical move towards synthesis of classical anarchist theory and thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy situationist international and postcolonialism left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labour positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self ownership in free market anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory there is strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho capitalism cannot be considered part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms internal issues and debates consistent with anarchist values is controversial subject among anarchists anarchism is philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism syndicalism trade unionism and capitalism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others on tactical level while propaganda of the deed was tactic used by anarchists in the th century the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate global one while others do so by local ones the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory free love french individualist anarchist emile armand who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century an important current within anarchism is free love free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as clear direct expression of an individual sovereignty free love particularly stressed women rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood the word free society as the firebrand as free society was major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries the publication advocated free love and women rights and critiqued comstockery censorship of sexual information also lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love in new york city greenwich village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others magnus hirschfeld noted in that goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public in fact before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the in his detroit based german language journal der arme teufel english the poor devil in argentina anarcha feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called english the woman voice which was published nine times in rosario between january and january and was revived briefly in in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults he was also consistent proponent of polyamory in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality mujeres libres was an anarchist women organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women it was founded in by lucía sánchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch gascón and had approximately members the organisation was based on the idea of double struggle for women liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists lucía sánchez saornil was main founder of the spanish anarcha feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism she was published in variety of literary journals where working under male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment more recently the british anarcho pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex the issue of free love has dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire and invention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques libertarian education and freethought francesc ferrer guàrdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and free thinker for english anarchist william godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness for godwin education had to have respect for the child autonomy which precluded any form of coercion pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child own motivation and initiatives and concern about the child capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school in his political justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established max stirner wrote in long essay on education called the false principle of our education in it stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment in the united states freethought was basically anti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters number of contributors to liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism the individualist anarchist george macdonald was co editor of freethought and for time the truth seeker walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal lucifer the light bearer many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer the light bearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty the church was viewed as common ally of the state and as repressive force in and of itself in catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in rational secular and non coercive setting fiercely anti clerical ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state murray bookchin wrote this period was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence perhaps the best known effort in this field was francisco ferrer modern school escuela moderna project which exercised considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally la escuela moderna and ferrer ideas generally formed the inspiration for series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london the first of these was started in new york city in it also inspired the italian newspaper università popolare founded in russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established school for peasant children on his estate tolstoy educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to neill founding what became summerhill school in summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of consumer society instead criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms

greek classical uncial version latin ad uncial version the earliest certain ancestor of is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from true alphabet in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as triangular head with two horns extended by bc the phoenician alphabet letter had linear form that served as the base for some later forms its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph blackletter ablackletter uncial auncial another capital aanother blackletter modern roman amodern roman modern italic amodern italic modern script amodern script when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems px english in modern english orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is

cave has been dated as early as to bc the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the word spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou sources disagree on the word meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the

exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in it was one of the rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to at the same time many rural people both white and african american migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city by the birmingham was the th largest city in the united states and had more than of the state population heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following lawsuit and court order beginning in the when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters the legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as violation of the fifteenth amendment the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution in the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently in the legislature study noted that because of rural domination minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county alabama challenged the state legislature lack of redistricting for congressional seats in white crook judge frank johnson ordered the state to redistrict united states supreme court cases of baker carr and reynolds sims ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as alabama had used for its senate in for the first time since the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been for more than years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the and to end and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in the us supreme court ruled in brown board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the congress legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by many of alabama african americans were living in the alabama cities particularly birmingham and montgomery in addition the rural black belt called that for its soil that stretches across the middle of the state is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry despite recommendations of alabama constitutional commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties there is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county level functions and policies this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the an omnibus redistricting case dillard crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens geography general map of alabama alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the united states with of total area of the

government is the alabama constitution which was ratified in at almost amendments and words it is by some accounts the world longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution there has been significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama constitution critics argue that alabama constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism the alabama judicial building in montgomery it houses the alabama supreme court alabama court of civil appeals and alabama court of criminal appeals alabama government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with members and the alabama senate with members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override gubernatorial veto by simple majority most state legislatures require two thirds majority to override veto until the state elected state senators on geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as result urbanized areas were grossly it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds sims the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments governor kay ivey is the current and second female governor of alabama she is the only republican female governor in the state history the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor of the state is republican kay ivey the office of lieutenant governor is currently vacant the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the state highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican lyn stuart all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas state which has population five times larger some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned convictions in death penalty cases it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use death sentence in cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries this judicial authority was removed in april taxes alabama levies or percent personal income tax depending upon the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax and can do so even if taking the standard deduction taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax social security and medicare tax the state general sales tax rate is sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is and there is an additional restaurant tax of which means that diner in mobile would pay an tax on meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low income families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply lower tax rate alabama income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the united states alabama is the only state that levies income tax on family of four with income as low as which is barely one quarter of the federal poverty line alabama threshold is the lowest among the states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the the current state constitution requires voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabama tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as million county and local governments treemap of the popular vote by county presidential election alabama has counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabama constitution has been amended more than times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning that the state government holds monopoly on the sale of alcohol the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state twenty five of the

pell city pell city politics during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the african american vote through violence fraud and intimidation after coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents process completed in provisions of the constitution provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites by more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised to the total effects were greater on the african american community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from through the the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until series of federal court cases required redistricting in to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the and during the civil rights movement when whites and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the state only four term governor was controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of and voting rights act of did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable more diverse representation among county boards in the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years after nearly complete realignment of political parties who represent different visions in the st century as of december there are total of registered voters with active and the others inactive in the state elections state elections with the of african americans in the state became part of the solid south system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late th century however there has been realignment among the two major political parties and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the then incumbent chief justice of alabama ernest hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to republican perry hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the two gop lt governors were steve windom and the current lt governor kay ivey who was elected in and re elected in local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions alabama county sheriffs are elected in partisan at large races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts the current split is democrats republicans and one independent fayette however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban suburban and heavily populated counties the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and ten african american sheriffs federal elections presidential elections results year republican democratic

aristotle aristotélēs bc was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira chalkidice on the northern periphery of classical greece his father nicomachus died when aristotle was child whereafter proxenus of atarneus became his guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined plato academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven bc his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theater music rhetoric psychology linguistics politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in bc teaching alexander the great gave aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies he established library in the lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books which were written on papyrus scrolls the fact that aristotle was pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism but following plato death aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism he believed all peoples concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception aristotle views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works aristotle views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics some of aristotle zoological observations such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were not confirmed or refuted until the th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic which was incorporated in the late th century into modern formal logic in metaphysics aristotelianism profoundly influenced jewish and islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was well known among medieval muslim scholars and has been revered as the first teacher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics all aspects of aristotle philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues cicero described his literary style as river of gold it is thought that only around third of his original output has survived life mieza macedonia greece aristotle whose name means the best purpose was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km miles east of modern day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon aristotle was orphaned at young age although there is little information on aristotle childhood he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy aristotle by francesco hayez portrait bust of aristotle an imperial roman st or nd century ad copy of lost bronze sculpture made by lysippos at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato academy he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy direction after control passed to plato nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared anti macedonian sentiments and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor there he traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island aristotle married pythias either hermias adoptive daughter or niece she bore him daughter whom they also named pythias soon after hermias death aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander in bc aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be leader to the greeks and despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him son whom he named after his father nicomachus according to the suda he also had an eromenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time but made significant contributions to most of them in physical science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology in philosophy he wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric and theology he also studied education foreign customs literature and poetry his combined works constitute virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander relationship with persia and persians widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing role in alexander death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexander death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy reference to athens prior trial and execution of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife charles walston argues that the tomb of aristotle is located on the sacred way between chalcis and eretria and to have contained two styluses pen signet ring and some terra cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of aristotle in the form of some skull fragments in general the details of the life of aristotle are not well established the biographies of aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on few salient points thought logic aristotle as portrayed in the nuremberg chronicle with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason preface to the second edition that with aristotle logic reached its completion history aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of however plato reports that syntax was devised before him by prodicus of ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications even plato had difficulties with logic although he had reasonable conception of deductive system he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his dialectic plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow consequently plato realized that method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial he never succeeded in devising such method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method analytics and the organon what we today call aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labeled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early st century ce categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning there is one volume of aristotle concerning logic not found in the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics aristotle epistemology plato left and aristotle right detail of the school of athens fresco by raphael aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience while holding copy of his nicomachean ethics in his hand whilst plato gestures to the heavens representing his belief in the forms while holding copy of timaeus ancient roman mosaic depicting aristotle römisch germanisches museum koln germany like his teacher plato aristotle philosophy aims at the universal aristotle ontology however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while in plato ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar for aristotle therefore epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these for aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in particular substance see universals and particulars below in certain sense aristotle method is both inductive and deductive while plato is essentially deductive from priori principles in aristotle terminology natural philosophy is branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences in modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays major role today philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method in contrast aristotle philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry in the larger sense of the word aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics by practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics if logic or analytics is regarded as study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of logic theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics and mathematics practical philosophy and poetical philosophy in the period between his two stays in athens between his times at the academy and the lyceum aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today in fact most of aristotle life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science aristotle metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics he did however perform original research in the natural sciences botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences aristotle writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative beginning in the th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and aristotle work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature he had conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers his writings provide an account of many scientific observations mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors for example in his history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females in similar vein john philoponus and later galileo showed by simple experiments that aristotle theory that heavier object falls faster than lighter object is incorrect on the other hand aristotle refuted democritus claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them aristotle also had some scientific blind spots he posited geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the th century from the rd century to the th century the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance these thinkers often took aristotle erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch however aristotle scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields for instance he founded logic as formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants geology as quoted from charles lyell principles of geology he aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time he alludes to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands previous to volcanic eruption the changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten he says th chapter of his meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to certain system and within certain period the concluding observation is as follows as time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the tanais nor the nile can have flowed for ever the places where they rise were once dry and there is limit to their operations but there is none to time so also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time physics five elements aristotle proposed fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles earth which is cold and dry this corresponds to the modern idea of solid water which is cold and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of liquid air which is hot and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of gas fire which is hot and dry this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma and heat aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies stars and planets each of the four earthly elements has its natural place all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe the center of the earth water tends toward sphere surrounding the center air tends toward sphere surrounding the water sphere fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the moon orbits when elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it this is natural motion motion requiring no extrinsic cause so for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles motion aristotle defined motion as the actuality of potentiality as such aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of potential as transition toward potentially possible state because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it causality the four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his name aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of table is wood and the material cause of car is rubber and steel it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form the arrangement of that matter it tells us what thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole macrostructure is the cause of its parts relationship known as the whole part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor and in the second place as intrinsic determining cause embodied in the matter formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs so take the two dominoes this time of equal weighting the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over the final cause telos is its purpose or that for the sake of which thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition need desire ethics or spiritual beliefs additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal thus aristotle first suggested reciprocal or circular causality as relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect moreover aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation all causes both proper and incidental can be spoken of as actual or potential and as generic or particular the same language refers to the effects of causes so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes generic effects to generic causes and particular effects to particular causes optics aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day the second oldest written evidence of camera obscura after mozi bc can be found in aristotle documentation of such device in bc in problemata aristotle apparatus contained dark chamber that had single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as round object in modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance for better understanding of aristotle conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place for example person seeks donations that person may find another person willing to donate substantial sum however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator result of chance it must be unusual that something happens by chance in other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions according to aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance metaphysics aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction he refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ousia in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that particular substance is combination of both matter and form in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia see also predicables that let us define something as house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the coming to be is change where nothing persists of which the resultant is property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when plant does one of the activities that plants do for that for the sake of which thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see in summary the matter used to make house has potentiality to be house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing universals and particulars aristotle predecessor plato argued that all things have universal form which could be either property or relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze form of an apple in this distinction there is particular apple and universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still proper universal form bertrand russell is th century philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things according to aristotle if universal exists either as particular or relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated consequently according to aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals as plato spoke of the world of the forms location where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms biology and medicine in aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition he dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded empirical research program octopus swimming torpedo fuscomaculata leopard shark aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas the works that reflect this research the history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes the most striking passages are about the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and angler fish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopods namely octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the th century he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē greek for sharks an example of his methods including dissection and observation comes from the generation of animals where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are generated aristotle gave accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus classification of living things aristotle distinguished about species of birds mammals and fishes what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood animals with blood were divided into live bearing mammals and egg bearing birds and fish invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into non shelled cephalopods and shelled and testacea molluscs aristotle believed that intellectual purposes final causes guided all natural processes such teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and single hooved animal with two horns have never seen aristotle suggested that nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such degree as they are necessary noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with nature trying to preserve type of balance he stated in the history of animals that creatures were arranged in graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals and on up to man forming the scala naturae or great chain of being his system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs for charles singer nothing is more remarkable than aristotle efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as scala naturae aristotle also held that the level of creature perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times he placed emphasis on the type of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals vegetative and sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans vegetative sensitive and rational soul capable of thought and reflection aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon successor theophrastus frontispiece to version of the expanded and illustrated edition of historia plantarum ca which was originally written around bc aristotle successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote series of books on botany the history of plants which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the middle ages many of theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel rather than focus on formal causes as aristotle did theophrastus suggested mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on aristotle concept of the efficient cause theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages influence on hellenistic medicine after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries ernst mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance aristotle ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly psychology aristotle psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche often known by its latin title de anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have rational soul this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them for aristotle the soul psyche was simpler concept than it is for us today by soul he simply meant the form of living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement memory according to aristotle memory is the ability to hold perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words memory is mental picture phantasm in which aristotle defines in de anima as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms memory aristotle believed an imprint becomes impressed on semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make memory memory occurs when stimuli is too complex that the nervous system semi fluid bodily organ cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation common sense and thinking the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as mental image in memory aristotle uses the word memory for two basic abilities first the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic imprint that can develop from sensation second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the imprint due to being impressed at particular time and processing specific contents these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after lapse of time therefore memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present the retrieval of our imprints cannot be performed suddenly transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience aristotle proposed that slow witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the imprint can easily continue however they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new imprints he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an imprint young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderly organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new imprints likewise people who are too quick witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have perception of time recollection because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or imprints people are continually weaving together new imprints of things they experience in order to search for these imprints people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the other if the chain of images is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed recollection is the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in memory imprint after some time has passed retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of being human or animal and the abilities the human or animal possesses only humans will remember imprints of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed recollection of an imprint is when the present experiences person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences when an imprint is recalled it may bring forth large group of related imprints aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain imprints was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships similarity contrast and contiguity these three laws make up his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams sleep before understanding aristotle views on dreams first his idea of sleep must be examined aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body including the senses so it can be revitalized while person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently than when person is awake because during sleep person can still have sensory experiences also not all of the senses are inactive during sleep only the ones that are weary theory of dreams dreams do not involve actually sensing stimulus because as discussed the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner than when awake aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when person stares at moving stimulus such as the waves in body of water when they look away from that stimulus the next thing they look at appears to be moving in wave like motion when person perceives stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant however during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake during sleep person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares sleeping person to person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward stimulus for example person who has strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings when person is asleep their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like person who is influenced by strong feelings since person sleeping is in this suggestible state they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams when asleep person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep they are unable to help person judge what is happening in their dream this in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not so the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it one component of aristotle theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by divine being aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes dream and what does not he claimed that dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if person had an image appear for moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that actually occurs while person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of dream for example if while person is sleeping door shuts and in their dream they hear door is shut aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake practical philosophy ethics aristotle considered ethics to be practical rather than theoretical study one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of thing an eye is only good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve virtuous and potentially happy character requires first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words philosopher politics aristotle classification of constitutions in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he also famously stated that man is by nature political animal and also arguing that humanity defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like machine and as collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotle conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner the common modern understanding of political community as modern state is quite different from aristotle understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as political community or partnership koinōnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences excerpt from speech by the character aristotle in the book protrepticus hutchinson and johnson for we all agree that the most excellent man should rule the supreme by nature and that the law rules and alone is authoritative but the law is kind of intelligence discourse based on intelligence and again what standard do we have what criterion of good things that is more precise than the intelligent man for all that this man will choose if the choice is based on his knowledge are good things and their contraries are bad and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions just man choosing to live justly man with bravery to live bravely likewise self controlled man to live with self control it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent for this is the function of that capacity hence it evident that according to the most authoritative judgment intelligence is supreme among goods rhetoric and poetics aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind advantages over animals while it is believed that aristotle poetics comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in tragedy are merely means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotle analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to women happiness as he did to men and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men loss and preservation of his works first page of edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls or rolls which was the common writing medium of that era modern scholarship reveals that aristotle lost works stray considerably in from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication the surviving works do not appear to have been so rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication the authenticity of portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle at all some of the individual works within the corpus including the constitution of athens are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision others such as on colors may have been produced by aristotle successors at the lyceum theophrastus and straton still others acquired aristotle name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and self promotional according to distinction that originates with aristotle himself his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric and the esoteric most scholars have understood this as distinction between works aristotle intended for the public exoteric and the more technical works intended for use within the lyceum course school esoteric modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle own unpolished lecture notes or in some cases possible notes by his students however one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation the th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotle writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant that all of aristotle extant writings are of the esoteric kind current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious though many of them may have been in dialogue form fragments of some of aristotle dialogues have survived perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotle writing style as river of gold it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us however some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that cicero praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle extant works one major question in the history of aristotle works then is how were the exoteric writings all lost and how did the ones we now possess come to us the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel lives the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis where his heirs let them languish in cellar until the st century bc when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts bringing them back to athens according to the story apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement introducing number of errors into the text when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in bc he carried off the library of apellicon to rome where they were first published in bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of rhodes carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period as well as for the sudden reappearance of flourishing aristotelianism during the first century lord voices number of reservations concerning this story however first the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon inexpert attempt at repair second there is evidence lord says that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis third the definitive edition of aristotle texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his and fourth ancient library catalogues predating andronicus intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess lord sees number of post aristotelian interpolations in the politics for example but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact on the one hand the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within aristotle school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy aristotle by jusepe de ribera aristotle with bust of homer by rembrandt thirteenth century islamic portrayal of aristotle statue by cipri adolf bermann at the university of freiburg more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method despite these achievements the influence of aristotle errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell also refers to aristotle ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter bringing with him on his expedition host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall surpass other men if those doctrines wherein have been trained are to be all men common property influence on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted fundamental critique of aristotle views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought after hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena influence on islamic theologians aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy in accordance with the greek theorists the muslims considered aristotle to be dogmatic philosopher the author of closed system and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo platonic metaphysical ideas influence on western christian theologians with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from ad to except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after thomas aquinas wrote his theology working from moerbeke translations the demand for aristotle writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance aristotle is referred to as the philosopher by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas see summa theologica part question etc these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages it required repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heed twenty bookes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophie the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell vidi maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vid ïo socrate platone che nnanzi li altri più presso li stanno saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest dante inferno hell canto iv lines post enlightenment thinkers the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle however debatable this is aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it is martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans list of works the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through

apollo attic ionic and homeric greek apollōn doric apellōn arcadocypriot apeilōn aeolic aploun is one of the most important and complex of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology the ideal of the kouros beardless athletic youth apollo has been variously recognized as god of music truth and prophecy healing the sun and light plague poetry and more apollo is the son of zeus and leto and has twin sister the chaste huntress artemis apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu as the patron of delphi pythian apollo apollo was an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius yet apollo was also seen as god who could bring ill health and deadly plague amongst the god custodial charges apollo became associated with dominion over colonists and as the patron defender of herds and flocks as the leader of the muses apollon musegetes and director of their choir apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry hermes created the lyre for him and the instrument became common attribute of apollo hymns sung to apollo were called paeans in hellenistic times especially during the rd century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios titan god of the sun and his sister artemis similarly equated with selene titan goddess of the moon in latin texts on the other hand joseph fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of apollo with sol among the augustan poets of the st century not even in the conjurations of aeneas and latinus in aeneid xii apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the rd century ce etymology apollo seated with lyre porphyry and marble nd century ad farnese collection naples italy the name apollo unlike the related older name paean is generally not found in the linear mycenean greek texts although there is possible attestation in the lacunose form pe rjo linear on the kn tablet the etymology of the name is uncertain the spelling in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form apellon is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier it probably is cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the family festival apellai according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the ecclesia beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested pre greek proto form apalyun several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors thus the greeks most often associated apollo name with the greek verb apollymi to destroy plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redemption with apolousis purification and with haploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word pella the capital of ancient macedonia and pellēnē pallene number of non greek etymologies have been suggested for the name the hittite form apaliunas is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter perhaps related to hurrian and certainly the etruscan aplu god of plague in turn likely from akkadian aplu enlil meaning simply the son of enlil title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending plague against the greeks the reasoning behind god of the plague becoming god of healing is of course apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter greco roman epithets apollo chief epithet was phoebus phoibos literally bright it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollo role as the god of light like other greek

omphalos in the museum of delphi the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the th century bce the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollo twin sister at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho for the greeks apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had strong function to keep away evil walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed dorian northwest greek component cretan minoan component and syro hittite component from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection of symbols and omina σημεία και τέρατα semeia kai terata and of the observation of the omens of the days the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced from anatolia the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning the greeks created the legalism the supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony apollo became the god of shining youth the protector of music spiritual life moderation and perceptible order the improvement of the old anatolian god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people healer and god protector from evil the function of apollo as healer is connected with paean the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from more primitive religion paeοn is probably connected with the mycenean pa ja wo ne linear but this is not certain he did not have separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magic song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean the magicians were also called seer doctors and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra he sends plague to the achaeans the god who sends disease can also prevent it therefore when it stops they make purifying ceremony and offer him hecatomb to ward off evil when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with song they call their own god the paean some common epithets of apollo as healer are paion literally healer or helper epikourios help oulios healed wound also scar and loimios plague in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios divert deter avert and alexikakos from defend from evil in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as god of healing homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollo son asclepius the healer about the th century bce the paean became merely formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music apollo role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when fleet left the harbour and also after victory had been won dorian origin apollo victorious over the python by the florentine pietro francavilla dated depicting apollo first triumph when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent python which lies dead at his feet the walters art museum the connection with the dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars the family festival was dedicated to apollo doric apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros the great kouros however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos the homeric hymn represents apollo as northern intruder his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated female dragon named delphyne womb and male serpent typhon to smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python python was the good daemon ἀγαθὸς δαίμων of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology in greek mythology artemis was the leader hegemon of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves the elf shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting stone arrow heads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiba is healer physician god however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult minoan origin minoan labrys it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean age in historical times the priests of delphi were called labryaden the double axe men which indicates minoan origin the double axe labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices apollo delphinios or delphidios was sea god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands apollo sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the mister of the animals male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute his original name is unknown but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo who stood by the virgin mistress of the animals becoming her brother the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that kind of inspiration prophecy existed in the temple this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel leaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania frenzy greek word he connected with mantis prophet frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc although crete had contacts with mari from bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece anatolian origin illustration of coin of apollo agyieus from ambracia non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollo mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylonian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites in hittite text is mentioned that the king invited babylonian priestess for certain purification similar story is mentioned by plutarch he writes that the cretan seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seer expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had resisting religion up to historical times it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war he is pictured as terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods the god seems to be related to appaliunas tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was tapered stone or column however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates babylonian origin the late bronze age from to bce hittite and hurrian aplu was god of plague invoked during plague years here we have an apotropaic situation where god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it aplu meaning the son of was title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash homer interprets apollo as terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing magic art that separates him from the other greek gods in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo oracular cult temple of apollo at delphi greece unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality apollo cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about bce apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites in the nd and rd century ce those at didyma and clarus pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity in the rd century apollo fell silent julian the apostate tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed oracular shrines delos lions apollo had famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus his oracular shrines include abae in phocis bassae in the peloponnese at clarus on the west coast of asia minor as at delphi holy spring which gave off pneuma from which the priests drank in corinth the oracle of corinth came from the town of tenea from prisoners supposedly taken in the trojan war at khyrse in troad the temple was built for apollo smintheus in delos there was an oracle to the delian apollo during summer the hieron sanctuary of apollo adjacent to the sacred lake was the place where the god was said to have been born in delphi the pythia became filled with the pneuma of apollo said to come from spring inside the adyton in didyma an oracle on the coast of anatolia south west of lydian luwian sardis in which priests from the lineage of the branchidae received inspiration by drinking from healing spring located in the temple was believed to have been founded by branchus son or lover of apollo in hierapolis bambyce syria modern manbij according to the treatise de dea syria the sanctuary of the syrian goddess contained robed and bearded image of apollo divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image at patara in lycia there was seasonal winter oracle of apollo said to have been the place where the god went from delos as at delphi the oracle at patara was woman in segesta in sicily oracles were also given by sons of apollo in oropus north of athens the oracle amphiaraus was said to be the son of apollo oropus also had sacred spring in labadea east of delphi trophonius another son of apollo killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle temples of apollo many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectanglular wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics the doric order dominated during the th and the th century bc but there was mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldn be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome the most important temples are greek temples thebes greece the oldest temple probably dedicated to apollo ismenius was built in the th century it seems that it was curvilinear building the doric temple was built in the early th century but only some small parts have been found festival called daphnephoria was celebrated every ninth year in honour of apollo ismenius or galaxius the people held laurel branches daphnai and at the head of the procession walked youth chosen priest of apollo who was called daphnephoros eretria according to the homeric hymn to apollo the god arrived to the plain seeking for location to establish its oracle the first temple of apollo daphnephoros apollo laurel bearer or carrying off daphne is dated to the temple was curvilinear hecatombedon hundred feet in smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building another temple probably peripteral

etruria there was prostyle porch which is called tuscan and triple cella wide falerii veteres etruria temple of apollo was built probably in the th rd century parts of teraccotta capital and teraccotta base have been found it seems that the etruscan columns were derived from the archaic doric cult of apollo soranus is attested by one inscription found near falerii plan of the temple of apollo pompeii pompeii italy the cult of apollo was widespread in the region of campania since the th century the temple was built in but its beginnings lie in the th century it was reconstructed after an earthquake in it demonstrates mixing of styles which formed the basis of roman architecture the columns in front of the cella formed tuscan prostyle porch and the cella is situated unusually far back the peripteral colonnade of ionic columns was placed in such way that the emphasis was given to the front side rome the temple of apollo sosianus and the temple of apollo medicus the first temple building dates to and was dedicated to apollo medicus the doctor after plague of it was rebuilt by gaius sosius probably in only three columns with corinthian capitals exist today it seems that

dedicated by augustus on the façade of the original temple was ionic and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble many famous statues by greek masters were on display in and around the temple including marble statue of the god at the entrance and statue of apollo in the cella melite modern mdina malta temple of apollo was built in the city in the nd century its remains were discovered in the th century and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures parts of the temple podium were rediscovered in mythology birth apollo left and artemis brygos potter signed tondo of an attic red figure cup bc musée du louvre when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant and that zeus was the father she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma in her wanderings leto found the newly created floating island of delos which was neither mainland nor real island she gave birth there and was accepted by the people offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city afterwards zeus secured delos to the bottom of the ocean this island later became sacred to apollo it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her necklace of amber long mythographers agree that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo or that artemis was born one day before apollo on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo apollo was born on the seventh day hebdomagenes of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him youth four days after his birth apollo killed the chthonic dragon python which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophecies hera sent the serpent to hunt leto to her death across the world to protect his mother apollo begged hephaestus for bow and arrows after receiving them apollo cornered python in the sacred cave at delphi apollo killed python but had to be punished for it since python was child of gaia hera then sent the giant tityos to rape leto this time apollo was aided by his sister artemis in protecting their mother during the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver trojan war marble bust of apollo after the apollo belvedere circa apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in retribution for agamemnon insult to chryses priest of apollo whose daughter chryseis had been captured he demanded her return and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad in the iliad when diomedes injured aeneas apollo rescued him first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well aeneas was then enveloped in cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos sacred spot in troy apollo aided paris in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into achilles heel one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles sacrilege in murdering troilus the god own son by hecuba on the very altar of the god own temple admetus when zeus struck down apollo son asclepius with lightning bolt for resurrecting hippolytus from the dead transgressing themis by stealing hades subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever for this but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor due to the intercession of his mother leto during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly admetus treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughter of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place but when it came time for admetus to die his parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to the world of the living artemis and apollo piercing niobe children with their arrows by jacques louis david dallas museum of art niobe niobe the queen of thebes and wife of amphion boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two apollo killed her sons and artemis her daughters apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them though according to some versions of the myth number of the niobids were spared chloris usually amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them consorts and children love affairs ascribed to apollo are late development in greek mythology their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination female lovers apollo and daphne by bernini in the galleria borghese daphne was nymph daughter of the river god peneus who had scorned apollo the myth explains the connection of apollo with δάφνη daphnē the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at delphi in ovid

orchamus the truth betraying her sister trust and confidence in her enraged orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and grieving clytia wilted and slowly died apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old castalia was nymph whom apollo loved she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named after her water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses in the last oracle is mentioned that the water which could speak has been lost for ever by cyrene apollo had son named aristaeus who became the patron god of cattle fruit trees hunting husbandry and bee keeping he was also culture hero and taught humanity dairy skills the use of nets and traps in hunting and how to cultivate olives hecuba was the wife of king priam of troy and apollo had son with her named troilus an oracle prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilus reached the age of twenty alive he was ambushed and killed by achilleus cassandra was daughter of hecuba and priam and troilus half sister apollo fell in love with cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her but she rejected him afterwards enraged apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future with curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her coronis was daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus crow informed apollo of the affair when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as punishment for spreading untruths when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis in other stories apollo himself had killed coronis as result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi apollo then killed him for what he did

apollonis borysthenis male lovers apollo and hyacinthus th century italian engraving by jacopo caraglio hyacinth or hyacinthus was one of apollo male lovers he was spartan prince beautiful and athletic the pair was practicing throwing the discus when discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly apollo is said to be filled with grief out of hyacinthus blood apollo created flower named after him as memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection meaning alas the festival of hyacinthus was celebration of sparta another male lover was cyparissus descendant of heracles apollo gave him tame deer as companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk other male lovers of apollo include admetus atymnius otherwise known as beloved of sarpedon branchus alternately son of apollo carnus clarus hippolytus of sicyon not the same as hippolytus the son of theseus hymenaios iapis leucates who threw himself off rock when apollo attempted to carry him off phorbas probably the son of triopas potnieus apollo lyre apollo with his lyre statue from pergamon museum berlin hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by zeus maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle the infant hermes stole number of his cows and took them to cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cow intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollo claim zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre hence apollo then became master of the lyre apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war and cassandra prophetess of apollo apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies female of vengeance apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollo supplicant apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo other stories apollo killed the aloadae when they attempted to storm mt olympus callimachus sang that apollo rode on the back of swan to the land of the hyperboreans during the winter months apollo turned cephissus into sea monster another contender for the birthplace of apollo is the cretan islands of paximadia musical contests pan once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo the god of the kithara the mountain god tmolus was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment he dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo would not suffer such depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of donkey marsyas marsyas under apollo punishment istanbul archaeology museum apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague bringing death dealing arrows marsyas was satyr who challenged apollo to contest of music he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy the contest was judged by the muses after they each performed both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time as apollo played the lyre this was easy to do marsyas could not do this as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time apollo was declared the winner because of this apollo flayed marsyas alive in cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge god he then nailed marsyas shaggy skin to nearby pine tree marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from tree and flayed him alive cinyras apollo also had lyre playing contest with cinyras his son who committed suicide when he lost head of apollo marble roman copy of greek original of the th century bce from the collection of cardinal albani roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus there was tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus on the occasion of pestilence in the bce apollo first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare during the second punic war in bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of prophecy attributed to one marcius in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium which was fought near sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollo temple dedicated portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected new temple to the god on the palatine hill sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in bce to celebrate the dawn of new era festivals the chief apollonian festivals were the boedromia carneia carpiae daphnephoria delia hyacinthia metageitnia pyanepsia pythia and thargelia attributes and symbols apollo most common attributes were the bow and arrow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollo honor every four years at delphi the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games gold stater of the seleucid king antiochus soter reigned bce showing on the reverse nude apollo holding his key attributes two arrows and bow the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas symbolizing music and song hawks ravens crows snakes referencing apollo function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin apollo citharoedus apollo with kithara musei capitolini rome as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization bce according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy however this story may reflect cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars in this interpretation apollo title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god supposed link with wolves possibly folk etymology in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase apollo is often associated with the golden mean this is the greek ideal of moderation and virtue that opposes gluttony apollo in the arts the louvre apollo sauroctonos roman copy after praxiteles bc apollo is common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance the earliest greek word for statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially religious activity the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in relative harmonious whole in late archaic period in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole method created by polykleitos finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are mixture of naturalism with stylization art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the natural philosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras thales searched for simple material form directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on transcendental mathematical relation the forms on earth are imperfect imitations eikones images of the celestial world of numbers his ideas had great influence on post archaic art the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection canon in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas the greek words oida know and eidos species thing seen have the same root as the word idea thing ἰδείν to see indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses the artists in plato time moved away from his theories and art tends to be mixture of naturalism with stylization the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual archaic sculpture kerameikos archaeological museum in athens kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo the first statues are certainly still and formal the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egyptian precedent but it was accepted for good reason the sculptors had clear idea of what young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods the adoption of standard recognizable type for long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented these forms expressed immortality apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order his shrine in delphi that he shared in winter with dionysius had the inscriptions gnōthi seautón know thyself and mēdén ágan nothing in excess and eggýa pára atē make pledge and mischief is nigh new york kouros met mus marble bc metropolitan museum of art in the first large scale depictions during the early archaic period bc the artists tried to draw one attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself piraeus apollo archaic style bronze archaeological museum of piraeus the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in specific moment these free standing statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period bc in which the greek sculpture attained full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create relative harmonious whole ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and cup of pouring libation in its right hand it probably comes from north eastern peloponnesus the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in post archaic art the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionian influence in athens finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later classical sculpture apollo of the mantoua type marble roman copy after th century bce greek original attributed to polykleitos musée du louvre at the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions the artists tried also to represent motion in specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm the type is represented by neo attic imperial roman copies of the late st or early nd century modelled upon supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the th century bce in style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze age just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of work of art spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in single unity pediments and friezes temple of zeus olympia greece in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had problem to fit group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration their two figures hold the centre in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene head of the apollo belvedere these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in larger whole while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest passage to and from busy battlefield the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought greater freedom and economy hellenistic greece rome apollo as handsome beardless young man is often depicted with kithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types the apollo belvedere is marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the th century the marble is hellenistic or roman copy of bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between and bce the life size so called adonis found in on the site of villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars in the late nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even god divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the rd century bce to depict alexander the great some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed modern reception apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature percy bysshe shelley composed hymn of apollo and the god instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinsky apollon musagète in the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdom dionysus bringer of love in discussion of the arts distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity friedrich nietzsche argued that fusion of the two was most desirable carl jung apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over intellectualise and maintain emotional distance charles handy in gods of management uses greek gods as metaphor to portray various types of organisational culture apollo represents role culture where

afroasiatic afro asiatic also known as afrasian and traditionally as hamito semitic chamito semitic or semito hamitic is large language family of about languages and dialects it includes languages spoken predominantly in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel afroasiatic languages have over million native speakers the fourth largest number of any language family after indo european sino tibetan and niger congo the phylum has six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic and semitic by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language is arabic language within the semitic branch it includes modern standard arabic as well as spoken colloquial varieties arabic has around million native speakers who are concentrated primarily in west asia north africa the horn of africa and malta other widely spoken afroasiatic languages include hausa chadic branch the dominant language of northern nigeria ghana and southern niger spoken as first language by over million people and used as lingua franca by another million across west africa and the sahel oromo cushitic branch spoken in ethiopia and kenya by around million people total amharic semitic branch spoken in ethiopia with over million native speakers in addition to millions of other ethiopians speaking it as second language somali cushitic branch spoken by million people in somalia djibouti eastern ethiopia and northeastern kenya hebrew semitic branch spoken by around million people in israel and worldwide tigrinya semitic branch spoken by around million people in eritrea and ethiopia kabyle berber branch spoken by around million people in algeria central atlas tamazight berber branch spoken by around million people in morocco neo aramaic languages semitic branch spoken by about people worldwide this is not just one language it includes number of subdivisions with assyrian neo aramaic being the most spoken variety in addition to languages spoken today afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as ancient egyptian akkadian biblical hebrew and old aramaic it is debated when and where the original homeland of the afroasiatic family existed proposed locations include north africa the horn of africa the eastern sahara and the levant etymology during the early linguists grouped the berber cushitic and egyptian languages within hamitic phylum in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum the terms hamitic and semitic were etymologically derived from the book of genesis which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem two sons of noah by the the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out the scholar friedrich müller introduced the name hamito semitic for the entire family in his grundriss der maurice delafosse later coined the term afroasiatic often now spelled afro asiatic however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg formally proposed its adoption in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that afroasiatic spanned the continents of both africa and asia individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker and lisramic hodge in lieu of hamito semitic the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the family constituent languages the term hamito semitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries distribution and branches interrelations between branches of afroasiatic lipiński some linguists proposals for grouping within afroasiatic the afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic semitic although there is general agreement on these six families there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study afroasiatic in particular the omotic language branch is the most controversial member of afroasiatic because the grammatical formatives that most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family are either absent or distinctly wobbly hayward greenberg and others considered it subgroup of cushitic whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of afroasiatic at all theil the afroasiatic identity of ongota is also broadly questioned as is its position within afroasiatic among those who accept it due to the mixed appearance of the language and paucity of research and data harold fleming proposes that ongota constitutes separate branch of afroasiatic bonny sands believes the most convincing proposal is by savà and tosco namely that ongota is an east cushitic language with nilo saharan substratum in other words it would appear that the ongota people once spoke nilo saharan language but then shifted to speaking cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier nilo saharan language beja is sometimes listed as separate branch of afroasiatic but is more often included in the cushitic branch which has high degree of internal diversity whether the various branches of cushitic actually form language family is sometimes questioned but not their inclusion in afroasiatic itself there is no consensus on the of the five non omotic branches of afroasiatic see subgrouping below this situation is not unusual even among long established language families there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the indo european languages for instance meroitic has been proposed as an unclassified afroasiatic language because it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family but there is not enough evidence to secure classification classification history in the th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together he perceived relationship between berber and semitic he knew of semitic through his study of arabic hebrew and aramaic in the course of the th century europeans also began suggesting such relationships in theodor benfey suggested language family consisting of semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic in the same year newman suggested relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain topic of dispute and uncertainty friedrich müller named the traditional hamito semitic family in in his grundriss der outline of linguistics and defined it as consisting of semitic group plus hamitic group containing egyptian berber and cushitic he excluded the chadic group it was the egyptologist karl richard lepsius who restricted hamitic to the non semitic languages in africa which are characterized by grammatical gender system this hamitic language group was proposed to unite various mainly north african languages including the ancient egyptian language the berber languages the cushitic languages the beja language and the chadic languages unlike müller lepsius considered that hausa and nama were part of the hamitic group these classifications relied in part on non linguistic anthropological and racial arguments both authors used the skin color mode of subsistence and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together distribution of the afroasiatic hamito semitic languages in africa in carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten the languages of the hamites in which he expanded lepsius model adding the fula maasai bari nandi sandawe and hadza languages to the hamitic group meinhof model was widely supported into the meinhof system of classification of the hamitic languages was based on belief that speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially caucasian origins intrinsically different from and superior to the negroes of africa but in the case of the so called nilo hamitic languages concept he introduced it was based on the typological feature of gender and fallacious theory of language mixture meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub nilo hamitic were in fact nilotic languages with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other nilotic languages leo reinisch had already proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging their more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic however his suggestion found little acceptance marcel cohen rejected the idea of distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa chadic language in his comparative hamito semitic vocabulary finally joseph greenberg work led to the widespread rejection of hamitic as language category by linguists greenberg refuted meinhof linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence in dismissing the notion of separate nilo hamitic language category in particular greenberg was returning to view widely held half century earlier he consequently rejoined meinhof so called nilo hamitic languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings he also added and sub classified the chadic languages and proposed the new name afroasiatic for the family almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus greenberg model was fully developed in his book the languages of africa in which he reassigned most of meinhof additions to hamitic to other language families notably nilo saharan following isaac schapera and rejecting meinhof he classified the hottentot language as member of the central khoisan languages to khoisan he also added the tanzanian hadza and sandawe though this view remains controversial since some scholars consider these languages to be linguistic isolates despite this greenberg model remains the basis for modern classifications of languages spoken in africa and the hamitic category and its extension to nilo hamitic has no part in this since the three traditional branches of the hamitic languages berber cushitic and egyptian have not been shown to form an exclusive monophyletic phylogenetic unit of their own separate from other afroasiatic languages linguists no longer use the term in this sense each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family in harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name omotic this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance several scholars including harold fleming and robert hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge it therefore splits off the following groups as small families south omotic mao dizoid gonga gimojan north omotic apart from the preceding ongota kujarge subgrouping proposed afroasiatic sub divisions greenberg newman fleming post ehret semitic egyptian

afrasian omotic cushitic little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic semitic egyptian berber chadic cushitic and omotic however christopher ehret harold fleming and joseph greenberg all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first otherwise paul newman groups berber with chadic and egyptian with semitic while questioning the inclusion of omotic in afroasiatic rolf theil concurs with the exclusion of omotic but does not otherwise address the structure of the family harold fleming divides non omotic afroasiatic or erythraean into three groups cushitic semitic and chadic berber egyptian he later added semitic and beja to chadic berber egyptian and tentatively proposed ongota as new third branch of erythraean he thus divided afroasiatic into two major branches omotic and erythraean with erythraean consisting of three sub branches cushitic chadic berber egyptian semitic beja and ongota like harold fleming christopher ehret divides afroasiatic into two branches omotic and erythrean he divides omotic into two branches north omotic and south omotic he divides erythrean into cushitic comprising beja agaw and east south cushitic and north erythrean comprising chadic and boreafrasian according to his classification boreafrasian consists of egyptian berber and semitic vladimir orel and olga stolbova group berber with semitic and chadic with egyptian they split up cushitic into five or more independent branches of afroasiatic viewing cushitic as sprachbund rather than language family igor diakonoff subdivides afroasiatic in two grouping berber cushitic and semitic together as east west afrasian esa and chadic with egyptian as north south afrasian nsa he excludes omotic from afroasiatic lionel bender groups berber cushitic and semitic together as macro cushitic he regards chadic and omotic as the branches of afroasiatic most remote from the others alexander militarev on the basis of groups berber with chadic and both more distantly with semitic as against cushitic and omotic he places ongota in south omotic position among the world languages afroasiatic is one of the four major language families spoken in africa identified by joseph greenberg in his book the languages of africa it is one of the few whose speech area is with languages from afroasiatic semitic branch also spoken in the middle east and europe there are no generally accepted relations between afroasiatic and any other language family however several proposals grouping afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made the best known of these are the following hermann möller argued for relation between semitic and the indo european languages this proposal was accepted by few linguists holger pedersen and louis hjelmslev for fuller account see indo semitic languages however the theory has little currency today although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families such as grammatical gender noun adjective agreement three way number distinction and vowel alternation as means of derivation apparently influenced by möller colleague of his at the university of copenhagen holger pedersen included hamito semitic the term replaced by afroasiatic in his proposed nostratic macro family cf pedersen also included the indo european uralic altaic yukaghir languages and dravidian languages this inclusion was retained by subsequent nostraticists starting with vladislav illich svitych and aharon dolgopolsky joseph greenberg did not reject relationship of afroasiatic to these other languages but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other grouping instead these other languages in separate macro family which he called eurasiatic and to which he added chukotian gilyak korean japanese ryukyuan eskimo aleut and ainu most recently sergei starostin school has accepted eurasiatic as subgroup of nostratic with afroasiatic dravidian and kartvelian in nostratic outside of eurasiatic the even larger borean super family contains nostratic as well as dené caucasian and austric date of afroasiatic neo aramaic language descendant of old aramaic the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription dated to bc years ago symbols on gerzean naqada ii pottery resembling egyptian hieroglyphs date back to bc suggesting an earlier possible dating this gives us minimum date for the age of afroasiatic however ancient egyptian is highly divergent from proto afroasiatic trombetti and considerable time must have elapsed in between them estimates of the date at which the proto afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely they fall within range between approximately bc years ago and approximately bc years ago according to igor diakonoff proto afroasiatic was spoken bc christopher ehret asserts that proto afroasiatic was spoken bc at the latest and possibly as early as bc these dates are older than those associated with other proto languages afroasiatic urheimat map showing one of the proposed afroasiatic urheimat the term afroasiatic urheimat urheimat meaning original homeland in german refers to the hypothetical place where proto afroasiatic language speakers lived in single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel their distribution seems to have been influenced by the sahara pump operating over the last years there is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed proposed

amphibians are ectothermic tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia modern amphibians are all lissamphibia they inhabit wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air breathing form with lungs amphibians use their skin as secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin they are superficially similar to lizards but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicators in recent decades there has been dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony limbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia the three modern orders of amphibians are anura the frogs and toads urodela the salamanders and apoda the caecilians the number of known amphibian species is approximately of which nearly are frogs the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with length of just the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology classification the world smallest known vertebrate paedophryne amauensis sitting on dime which is mm in diameter for scale the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος amphíbios which means both kinds of life ἀμφί meaning of both kinds and βιος meaning life the term was initially used as general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct subclass lepospondyli small paleozoic group which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than lissamphibia subclass temnospondyli diverse paleozoic and early mesozoic grade subclass lissamphibia all modern amphibians including frogs toads salamanders newts and caecilians salientia frogs toads and relatives jurassic to present current species in families caudata salamanders newts and relatives jurassic to present current species in families gymnophiona caecilians and relatives jurassic to present current species in families triadobatrachus massinoti proto frog from the early triassic of madagascar the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over of which nearly are frogs with the phylogenetic classification the taxon has been discarded as it is group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use stem based or node based classification traditionally amphibians as class are defined as all tetrapods with larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibian type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes paraphyletic group all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered clade group of species that have evolved from common ancestor the three modern orders are anura the frogs and toads caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from temnospondyl like ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes although the fossils of several older proto frogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species eocaecilia micropodia also from arizona the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china authorities disagree as to whether salientia is superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is sub order of the order salientia the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamander like family the is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto frog triadobatrachus evolutionary history the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around million years ago from lobe finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish these ancient lobe finned fish had evolved multi jointed leg like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammals despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs it had four sturdy limbs neck tail with fins and skull very similar to that of the lobe finned fish eusthenopteron amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to support the weight of their bodies on land they developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation the fish hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra occipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom the permian lepospondyl diplocaulus was largely aquatic at the end of the devonian period million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in similar manner to that used by the elephant seal in the early carboniferous to million years ago the climate became wet and warm extensive swamps developed with mosses ferns horsetails and calamites air breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had long tapering body and strong tail they were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water they still needed to return to water to lay their shell less eggs and even most modern amphibians have fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors it was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles and amphibians were further devastated by the permian triassic extinction event during the triassic period to million years ago the reptiles continued to out compete the amphibians leading to reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests late carboniferous early permian origin for extant amphibians the temnospondyl eryops had sturdy limbs to support its body on land the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is matter of debate molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe finned fish the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils there are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of gerobatrachus hottoni from the early permian in texas in provided missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs molecular analysis suggests that the frog salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the evidence indicates newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about million years ago and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in terrestrial environment their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss characteristics the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in it has an average length of and is part of genus that contains four of the world ten smallest frog species the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed the extinct prionosuchus crocodile like temnospondyl dating to million years ago from the middle permian of brazil the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach and weigh amphibians are ectothermic cold blooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes their metabolic rate is low and as result their food and energy requirements are limited in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from few fish like scales in certain caecilians the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands type of granular gland the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults amphibians breathe by means of pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin anura red eyed tree frog agalychnis callidryas with limbs and feet specialised for climbing the order anura from the ancient greek meaning without and oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with warty skins are known as toads the difference is not formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads frogs range in size from the goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in which is also the smallest known vertebrate although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts they are found worldwide except for polar areas anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships the suborder contains four families of primitive frogs these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species ninety six percent of the over extant species of frog are neobatrachians caudata japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus primitive salamander the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamanders elongated low slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form this is trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals salamanders lack claws have scale free skins either smooth or covered with tubercles and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to length of to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds in length salamanders have mostly laurasian distribution being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene million years ago urodela is name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults most salamanders are under long they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates danube crested newt triturus dobrogicus an advanced salamander the suborder contains the primitive salamanders number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation in salamandrids the male deposits bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes of all salamander species the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in single family sirenidae members of this order are eel like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs some of their features are primitive while others are derived fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage despite this the eggs are laid singly behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation gymnophiona the limbless south american caecilian siphonops paulensis the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda from the latin an meaning without and the greek poda meaning legs comprises the caecilians these are long cylindrical limbless animals with snake or worm like form the adults vary in length from to centimetres to inches with the exception of thomson caecilian caecilia thompsoni which can reach caecilian skin has large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity it also has pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct caecilians have mostly gondwanan distribution being found in tropical regions of africa asia and central and south america anatomy and physiology skin bright colours of the common reed frog hyperolius viridiflavus are typical of toxic species the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes amphibians often eat the sloughed skin caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages cross section of frog skin mucus gland chromatophore granular poison gland connective tissue stratum corneum transition zone epidermis dermis amphibian skin is permeable to water gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect the main poison producing glands the paratoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing blue green colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is warning sign to predators skeletal system and locomotion amphibians have skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with number of variations they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs the bones are hollow and lightweight the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the well developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by pair of sacral ribs the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals skeleton of the surinam horned frog ceratophrys cornuta in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel like in appearance with tiny stubby legs the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs the caecilians are limbless they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as prop particularly when climbing in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobe finned fish some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as means of propulsion adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in process known as autotomy certain species in the plethodontidae have weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape both tails and limbs can be regenerated adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so circulatory system didactic model of an amphibian heart juvenile amphibian circulatory systems are single loop systems which resemble fish internal gills where the blood is reoxygenated point where the blood is depleted of oxygen and returns to the heart via veins two chambered heart red indicates oxygenated blood and blue represents oxygen depleted blood amphibians have juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of fish the two chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated and is spread around the body and back to the heart in single loop in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs they have heart that consists of single ventricle and two atria when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers nervous and sensory systems the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with central brain spinal cord and nerves throughout the body the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of fish it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain the brain consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning the cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians some caecilians possess that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water the ears are well developed in frogs there is no external ear but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye this vibrates and sound is transmitted through single bone the stapes to the inner ear only high frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but low frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism there is patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the columella operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more dome shaped the lens becomes flatter and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes they allow colour vision and depth of focus in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to wide range of wavelengths digestive and excretory systems dissected frog right atrium liver aorta egg mass colon left atrium ventricle stomach left lung gallbladder small intestine cloaca many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey amphibians possess pancreas liver and gall bladder the liver is usually large with two lobes its size is determined by its function as glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen in internal structures called fat bodies under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail there are two kidneys located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid respiratory system the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum retains its larval form with gills into adulthood the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal septa and large alveoli and consequently having comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at sufficiently high rate because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontid salamanders which have neither lungs nor gills many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults reproduction male orange thighed frog litoria xanthomera grasping the female during amplexus for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist few fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations the pacific platymantis the australo papuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free standing water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often storm in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the phallodeum and inserting it into the female cloaca the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation in most of these the male deposits spermatophore small packet of sperm on top of gelatinous cone on the substrate either on land or in the water the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and practice external fertilisation in similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass with few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm roughened nuptial pads on the male hands aid in retaining grip often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming sort of basket with the hind feet an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female this frog lives in fast flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders typically prolonged breeders congregate at breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over territory the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid the females depart and territories may change hands more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at breeding site they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find suitable place perhaps pool that forms in the same place each rainy season the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females sexual selection has been studied in the red back salamander there is direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with some species store sperm through long breeding seasons as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm life cycle most amphibians go through metamorphosis process of significant morphological change after birth in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxine effect specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues because most embryonic development is outside the parental body it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth whisker like skin extensions or fins they also make use of sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish after metamorphosis these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death called apoptosis the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide with many discoveries still being made eggs frogspawn mass of eggs surrounded by jelly amphibian egg jelly capsule vitelline membrane perivitelline fluid yolk plug embryo the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and this capsule is permeable to water and gases and swells considerably as it absorbs water the ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely this also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation caecilians some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups or may take the form of spherical egg masses rafts or long strings in terrestrial caecilians the eggs are laid in grape like clusters in burrows near streams the amphibious salamander ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots the greenhouse frog planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds floating nest from foam to protect its eggs first raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally foam cap is overlaid the foam has anti microbial properties it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female larvae early stages in the development of the embryos of the common frog rana temporaria the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the african live bearing toads nectophrynoides spp are viviparous their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female oviduct often for long periods other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparous the eggs are retained in or on the parent body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members frogs frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails with fins the free living larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are semi terrestrial and live among wet rocks tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by horny beak front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible few days later amphibian metamorphosis iodine and over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis programmed cell death of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting in fact tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies large caudal fins and small mouths they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths shallow bodies and caudal fins they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria they also feed on diatoms filtered from the water through the gills and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond ingesting edible fragments they have relatively long spiral shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalistic the younger tadpoles attacking larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely the spiral shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut the animal develops large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac eyes and legs grow quickly and tongue is formed there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system all this can happen in about day few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place salamanders larva of the long toed salamander ambystoma macrodactylum larvae of the alpine newt ichthyosaura alpestris at hatching typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills somewhat laterally flattened body and long tail with dorsal and ventral fins the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water pond type larvae often have pair of balancers rod like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment some members of the genera ambystoma and dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult both of these are able to breed neoteny occurs when the animal growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of population that would otherwise die out there are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders including species of necturus proteus and amphiuma and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay small number of unpigmented eggs in cluster among damp leaf litter each egg has large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as juvenile salamander the female salamander often broods the eggs in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with mucous secretion in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and land phase in winter for adaptation to water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time caecilians the caecilian ichthyophis glutinosus with eggs and developing embryo most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus species from sri lanka has been much studied the eel like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water they have three pairs of external red feathery gills blunt head with two rudimentary eyes lateral line system and short tail with fins they swim by undulating their body from side to side they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land metamorphosis is gradual by the age of about ten months they have developed pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments by this time the caecilian has constructed burrow and is living on land ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus resembles an earthworm in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by vivipary typhlonectes compressicauda species from south america is typical of these up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time they are elongated and have paired sac like gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall they may increase their length sixfold and be two fifths as long as their mother before being born by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction the progeny feed on skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy the brood feed as batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca parental care male common rocket frog colostethus panamensis carrying tadpoles on his back the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place nevertheless it is estimated that in up to of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders the male hellbender primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans carrying eggs the male colostethus subpunctatus tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under stone or log when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by mucous secretion to temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off the male midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles the female gastric brooding frog rheobatrachus spp reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct the tadpoles secrete hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to suitable water filled crevice such as the axil of leaf or the rosette of bromeliad the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles feeding and diet northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile eating worm with few exceptions adult amphibians are predators feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders the sirens siren spp often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes large quantity of fruit in its diet the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light movement of the prey triggers feeding response frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves cave dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth feature unique to amphibians the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp have no teeth in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to facial bone in the roof of the mouth edible frog pelophylax esculentus exhibiting cannibalism the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates others amphibians such as the bufo spp toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well camouflaged caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward pointing teeth the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow the subdued prey is gulped down whole when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out others have specialised mouthparts consisting of horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic vocalization male treefrog dendropsophus microcephalus inflating his air sac as he calls the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks grunts or hisses and have not been much studied clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be means of orientation as in bats or form of communication most salamanders are considered voiceless but the california giant salamander dicamptodon ensatus has vocal cords and can produce rattling or barking sound some species of salamander emit quiet squeak or yelp if attacked american toad anaxyrus americanus singing frogs are much more vocal especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates the presence of particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by fleeting glimpse of the animal itself in most species the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth this may distend like balloon and acts as resonator helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere or the water at times when the animal is submerged the main vocalisation is the male loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory this call is modified to quieter courtship call on the approach of female or to more aggressive version if male intruder draws near calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy other calls include those given by female in response to the advertisement call and release call given by male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus when frog is attacked distress or fright call is emitted often resembling scream the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis produces rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours territorial behaviour little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs the red back salamander plethodon cinereus defends territory against intruders in salamanders defence of territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of tail the behaviour of red back salamanders plethodon cinereus has been much studied of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within metre yard of their original daytime retreat under log or rock similar proportion when moved experimentally distance of found their way back to their home base the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by male and female pair these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively if the intruder persisted biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso labial grooves damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates in general deeper voice represents heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by fitter rival if he tires there is tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders holders of territories have home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar sized frogs if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponent vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water defence mechanisms cane toad rhinella marina with poison glands behind the eyes amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in feeding experiment in brazil in some salamanders the skin is poisonous the rough skinned newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic non protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis in locations where both snake and salamander co exist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms altogether over toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated the fire salamander salamandra salamandra toxic species wears warning colours perhaps the most poisonous animal in the world the golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis is endemic to colombia poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example once predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters similar animal in some species such as the fire bellied toad bombina spp the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality strategy that may deceive predators many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by potential predator such as the north american northern short tailed shrew blarina brevicauda their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison producing granular glands few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape the tail may have constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with defensive bite the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape cognition in amphibians there is evidence of habituation associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning and discrimination abilities in one experiment when offered live fruit flies drosophila virilis salamanders choose the larger of vs and vs frogs can distinguish between low numbers vs vs but not vs and large numbers vs vs but not vs of prey this is irrespective of other characteristics surface area volume weight and movement although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area conservation the extinct golden toad bufo periglenes last seen in dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity in the international union for conservation of nature iucn reported stating that currently birds mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum times greater than natural extinction rates possibly times higher in there were believed to be species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle of these were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species climate change endocrine disrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are topic of ongoing discussion the hula painted frog discoglossus nigriventer was believed to be extinct but was rediscovered in with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators in many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species in the middle east growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline the western terrestrial garter snake thamnophis elegans in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers the yosemite toad bufo canorus and the mountain yellow legged frog rana muscosa putting the snake future at risk if the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences global strategy to stem the crisis was released in in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan developed by over eighty leading experts in the field this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex situ conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create country wide response to the threat of see also list

aldous leonard huxley july november was an english writer novelist philosopher and prominent member of the huxley family he graduated from balliol college at the university of oxford with first class honours in english literature the author of nearly fifty books he was best known for his novels including brave new world set in dystopian future for non fiction works such as the doors of perception

huxley also became outstanding biologists aldous had another brother noel trevelyan huxley who committed suicide after period of clinical depression as child huxley nickname was ogie short for ogre he was described by his brother julian as someone who frequently contemplated the strangeness of things according to his cousin and contemporary gervas huxley he had an early interest in drawing huxley education began in his father well equipped botanical laboratory after which he enrolled at hillside school near godalming he was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill after hillside he went on to eton college his mother died in when he was in he contracted the eye disease keratitis punctata which left him practically blind for two to three years this ended his early dreams of becoming doctor in october huxley went up to balliol college oxford where he read english literature in january he volunteered to join the british army in the great war but was rejected on health grounds being half blind in one eye his eyesight later partly recovered in he edited oxford poetry and in june of that year graduated ba with first class honours his brother julian wrote following his years at balliol huxley being financially indebted to his father decided to find employment from april to july he was in charge of ordering supplies at the air ministry he taught french for year at eton where eric blair who was to take the pen name george orwell and steven runciman were among his pupils he was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class nevertheless blair and others spoke highly of his brilliant command of language significantly huxley also worked for time during the at brunner and mond high tech chemical plant in billingham in county durham northeast england according to the introduction to the latest edition of his great science fiction novel brave new world the experience he had there of an ordered universe in world of planless incoherence was an important source for the novel career huxley completed his first unpublished novel at the age of and began writing seriously in his early establishing himself as successful writer and social satirist his first published novels were social satires crome yellow antic hay those barren leaves and point counter point brave new world was huxley fifth novel and first dystopian work in the he was also contributor to vanity fair and british vogue magazines bloomsbury set left to right bloomsbury group members lady ottoline morrell maria nys lytton strachey duncan grant and vanessa bell during world war huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor near oxford home of lady ottoline morrell working as farm labourer there he met several bloomsbury figures including bertrand russell alfred north whitehead and clive bell later in crome yellow he caricatured the garsington lifestyle jobs were very scarce but in john middleton murry was reorganising the athenaeum and invited huxley to join the staff he accepted immediately and quickly married the belgian refugee maria nys also at garsington they lived with their young son in italy part of the time during the where huxley would visit his friend lawrence following lawrence death in huxley edited lawrence letters works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress most famously brave new world and on pacifist themes for example eyeless in gaza in brave new world set in dystopian london huxley portrays society operating on the principles of mass production and pavlovian conditioning huxley was strongly influenced by matthias alexander and included him as character in eyeless in gaza starting from this period huxley began to write and edit non fiction works on pacifist issues including ends and means an encyclopedia of pacifism and pacifism and philosophy and was an active member of the peace pledge union united states in huxley moved to hollywood with his wife maria son matthew huxley and friend gerald heard he lived in the us mainly in southern california until his death but also for time in taos new mexico where he wrote ends and means published in the book contains tracts on war religion nationalism and ethics heard introduced huxley to vedanta upanishad centered philosophy meditation and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa in huxley befriended jiddu krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired he also became vedantist in the circle of hindu swami prabhavananda and introduced christopher isherwood to this circle not long after huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world huxley book affirmed sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and huxley became close friend of remsen bird president of occidental college he spent much time at the college which is in the eagle rock neighbourhood of los angeles the college appears as tarzana college in his satirical novel after many summer the novel won huxley british literary award the james tait black memorial prize for fiction huxley also incorporated bird into the novel during this period huxley earned substantial income as hollywood screenwriter christopher isherwood in his autobiography my guru and his disciple states that huxley earned more than per week an enormous sum in those days as screenwriter and that he used much of it to transport jewish and left wing writer and artist refugees from hitler germany to the us in march his friend anita loos novelist and screenwriter put him in touch with metro goldwyn mayer who hired huxley for madame curie which was originally to star greta garbo and be directed by george cukor eventually the film was completed by mgm in with different director and cast huxley received screen credit for pride and prejudice and was paid for his work on number of other films including jane eyre huxley was commissioned by walt disney in to write script based on alice adventures in wonderland and the biography of the story author lewis carroll the script was not used however huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of unwin book hopousia or the sexual and economic foundations of new society on october huxley wrote to george orwell author of nineteen eighty four congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is in his letter to orwell he predicted huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself from these he made some warnings in his writings and talks in televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion the tendency to promote modern politicians to naive public as well marketed commodities post world war ii in huxley and maria applied for united states citizenship and presented themselves for examination when huxley refused to bear arms for the us and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals the only excuse allowed under the mccarran act the judge had to adjourn the proceedings he withdrew his application nevertheless he remained in the us in huxley turned down an offer of knight bachelor by the macmillan government without putting forward reason his brother julian had been knighted in while another brother andrew would be knighted in association with vedanta beginning in and continuing until his death in huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california founded and headed by swami prabhavananda together with gerald heard christopher isherwood and other followers he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices in huxley wrote the introduction to the bhagavad gita the song of god translated by swami prabhavananda and christopher isherwood which was published by the vedanta society of southern california from until huxley contributed articles to vedanta and the west published by the society he also served on the editorial board with isherwood heard and playwright john van druten from through huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples two of those lectures have been released on cd knowledge and understanding and who are we from nonetheless huxley agnosticism together with his speculative propensity made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of religion in the spring of huxley had his first experience with psychedelic drugs in this case mescaline huxley had initiated correspondence with dr humphry osmond british psychiatrist then employed in canadian institution and eventually asked him to supply dose of mescaline osmond obliged and supervised huxley session in southern california after the publication of the doors of perception in which he recounted this experience huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but huxley continued to write articles for the society journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions eyesight there are differing accounts about the details of the quality of huxley eyesight at specific points in his life about huxley encountered the bates method for better eyesight and teacher margaret darst corbett who was able to teach the method to him in huxley relocated from hollywood to ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northern los angeles county huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert he reported that for the first time in more than years he was able to read without glasses and without strain he even tried driving car along the dirt road beside the ranch he wrote book about his successes with the bates method the art of seeing which was published in us uk the book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created growing degree of popular controversy about huxley eyesight it was and is widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford for example some ten years after publication of the art of seeing in bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty then suddenly he faltered and the disturbing truth became obvious he wasn reading his address at all he had learned it by heart to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes when it was only an inch or so away he still couldn read it and had to fish for magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him it was an agonising moment brazilian author joão ubaldo ribeiro who as young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys company in the late wrote that huxley had said to him with wry smile can hardly see at all and don give damn really ribeiro then proceeds to confirm bennett cerf experience as described above on the other hand huxley second wife laura archera would later emphasise in her biographical account this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight after revealing letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as poor fellow who can hardly see by walter alvarez she tempered this although feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision for instance although aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use magnifying lens laura huxley proceeded to elaborate few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxley vision her account in this respect is discernibly congruent with the following sample of huxley own words from the art of seeing the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable nevertheless the topic of huxley eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversy regardless of how trivial subject matter it might initially appear american popular science author steven johnson in his book mind wide open quotes huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding am and for as long as can remember have always been poor visualizer words even the pregnant words of poets do not evoke pictures in my mind no hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep when recall something the memory does not present itself to me as vividly seen event or object by an effort of the will can evoke not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon personal life huxley married maria nys september february belgian he met at garsington oxfordshire in they had one child matthew huxley april february who had career as an author anthropologist and prominent epidemiologist in maria died of cancer in huxley married laura archera also an author as well as violinist and psychotherapist she wrote this timeless moment biography of huxley laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their marriage through mary ann braubach documentary huxley on
